# What have you done to learn your skill?

- Built an (almost) working proof-of-concept for a 'content approval' system
- Followed a guide on how to publish packages to npm
- Read about how TypeScript type definitions are packaged with CommonJS modules/libraries 

# What have you learned?

- You can install npm packages directly from GitHub projects, zipped binaries, local directories and even using symbolic links!
- The most popular templating language (Mustache) is ancient. Twitter developed a package called `Hogan.js` for rendering these templates. It's still widely used although unmaintained. `Handlebars.js` extends its features and is also very popular
- To always ensure you aren't re-inventing the wheel

# What have you done to contribute to your project?

- 'content approval' system
- Started to work on SSO authentication project

# Have you amended your goal? If so, how?

I have not amended my goal.

# Next Steps:
