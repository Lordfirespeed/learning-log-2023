# What have you done to learn your skill?

- I have created a 'template' project that contains configuration for most of the development tools I would like to use to help me achieve my goal. 
I have set-up configuration for:
  - TypeScript compiler
  - Jest (using `ts-jest`)
  - ESLint (using a TypeScript plugin)
  - nodemon
- I set up a local MySQL database using the schema of an existing database

# What have you learned?

- I learned that using commonJS tools such as ESLint, Jest and Nodemon with TypeScript is not trivial
- I learned how to create users and alter their permissions in an interactive MySQL commandline session

# What have you done to contribute to your project?

- The aforementioned 'template' project will be used as a basis for other codebases created by our organisation. 
- I refactored a proof-of-concept prototype to use `async`-`await` syntax instead of `.then(...)` syntax. 
In this manner, I was able to make the code much more readable, for example this strategy reduced nesting levels from >10 -> <4

# Have you amended your goal? If so, how?

I have not amended my goal.

# Next Steps:

- Utilise the 'template' project to build a working TypeScript app / proof-of-concept
- Investigate Next.js / React for building a web frontend with some SSR
